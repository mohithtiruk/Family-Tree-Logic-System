# Family-Tree-Logic-System
This project is a simple, knowledge-based system implemented in Prolog that models a family structure. It defines facts about individuals and their parent-child relationships, and uses logical rules to infer more complex familial relationships across generations, such as grandfather, aunt, brother, and ancestor.
